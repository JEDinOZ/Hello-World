# Hello-World
My first Hit-Hub repository

Started "programming" a plugboard on a Hollerith punched card system in 1959 as part of a clerical role.  Became an accountant and later programmed a rudimentory stock control system in FORTRAN for a client in 1963 to understand computers.  Switched to programming later that year and spent 30 years in the computer business (NCR) although only a few years in programming in assembly languages, COBOL and some script-based "languages" before getting lost in management, product development and strategy.  Picked up the original BASIC along the way, both on mainframes and the Radio Shack TRS-80 "Personal Computer".  Hopelessly out of date in computing but maintained an interest and struggle along with current technology from first principles to guess at how to use/fix "easy-to-use" software!  Play a little with some personal use programs mainly in Excel/VBA.  Signed up to Git-Hub years ago but lost access and created new user today to find whether SeleniumBasic will help now that my old code in VBA on Windows XP is getting hard to keep running!
